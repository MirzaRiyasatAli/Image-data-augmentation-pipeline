# Data Augmentation Pipeline for YOLO Datasets

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for augmenting images and YOLO-format bounding box annotations. The notebook uses the `albumentations` library to apply transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping.

## Features
- Supports YOLO-format bounding box annotations.
- Augments images with various transformations.
- Displays original and augmented images for comparison.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
